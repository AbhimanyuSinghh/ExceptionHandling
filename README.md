# ExceptionHandling

A basic Exception Handling example in Python, where a Bank class will create an account using constructor with the balance provided by the 
user while creating the object and then there are 3 edge cases to handle the program. A function named withdraw would help user withdraw thew amount,
depending on the amount provided by the user, the exception is raised and eventually handled if the withdrawl amount is lesser
or negative than the present account balance and then one final true case, where a transaction can happen. 
That is why a for loop is present in the driver function, to take all the three test cases.
